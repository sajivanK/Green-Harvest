# 🌱 GreenHarvest – Food & Waste Management Solutions

## 📖 Project Overview
**GreenHarvest** is an integrated digital platform designed to address two major challenges:  
1. Supporting **local agriculture** by connecting farmers directly with consumers.  
2. Promoting **sustainability** through a smart waste management system.  

By combining an **e-marketplace** for farmers with an **IoT-enabled waste management system**, GreenHarvest empowers communities to access fresh produce, reduce middlemen costs, and ensure cleaner cities and villages.  

The project was developed as part of the **ITP (Information Technology Project)** at the **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**, following MERN stack development principles with a light-themed, user-friendly design.

## 🛠️ My Contribution – Sajivan K.

I was primarily responsible for **Farmer & Product Management** and the **Payment Gateway integration**.  
My role ensured that farmers had full control over their products, consumers had a seamless shopping experience, and transactions were secure and transparent.  

### 🔑 Modules I Developed

#### 1. Farmer Management
- **Farmer Registration & Verification**  
  - Farmers can register with farm details, upload documents, and verify via OTP.  
- **Product Management (CRUD)**  
  - Add, edit, and delete products with details like name, description, price, stock, category, and images.  
- **QR Code Generation**  
  - Each product automatically generates a QR code.  
  - Consumers can scan the QR code to view farmer details, product origin, and authenticity.  
- **Subscription Packages**  
  - Farmers can create recurring delivery packages (weekly/monthly).  
  - Provides stable income for farmers and convenience for consumers.  
- **Analytics Dashboard**  
  - Track sales, order history, income summaries, and product performance.

#### 2. Payment Gateway
- **Secure Transactions**  
  - Integrated OTP-based and email-verified payments.  
  - Supports multiple methods: card, wallet, bank transfer, and cash-on-delivery.  
- **Order-Linked Payments**  
  - Payments tied directly to specific order IDs for transparency.  
- **PDF Invoices**  
  - Auto-generated receipts sent via email and downloadable from the dashboard.  
- **Notifications**  
  - Real-time updates to farmers and consumers about orders, payments, and delivery status.
